## Good Aspects of this Interface Design
1. All the main sections are listed at the top and can be reached by clicking on the rectangles as opposed to the word.
2. The more important information is emphasized through the use of larger fonts and darker colors. 
3. All the fonts are nicely contrasted by the background color and are easily legibile.
4. . Everything that is hyperlinked ia also in a blue font. This aids in creating a clear distinction between hyperlinks and regular text.

## Bad Aspects of this Interface Design
1. There is no destinction between the different tabs and everything looks generally the same with no change in color either. By using the same colors the same importance is placed on most of the things on the site.
2. There are no images on the site which means the site is likely less engagaging to users.
3. Spacing is off on page making it too time consuming to scroll through.
4. While the fonts are legibible, they are quite basic.

My Suggestions to Make the Interface Design Better:
> I suggect the addition of more colors to the site and some images so the user is engaged and can also recall where things are based on color rather than having to remember.
